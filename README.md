# quantum-paraelectric-model

This code is part of an implementation of a constrained 4-state quantum clock model on a 2D lattice inspired by the paraelectric-to-ferroelectric transitions in titanium dioxide (TiOâ‚‚).

A translationally invariant residual CNN is used to model the ground state, following the architecture introduced by Zakari Denis and Giuseppe Carleo in "Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons" (arXiv:2404.07869, 2024).
